About my project:
 - Basically this is a website where I am promoting my music teaching service.
 - When they visit this site they can see the first three services of the database which were added newly.
 - Clicking "See All Services" they can see all the services.
 - There is a button called "View Details" where they can see all the details.
 - There is a section of review.
 - If users logged in then they can see the reviews and they have a text field to add reveiw. But if the not logged in then they have to log in first.
 - There is an add service page where I can add more services.
 - There a route called "My Reviews" from where they can see the reviews added by only them. They can edit and delete the reviews from there.
